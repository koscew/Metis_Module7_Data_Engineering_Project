# Metis_Module7_Data_Engineering_Project

This is the seventh project of Metis Data Science Bootcamp. We are gong to use a large to massive scale dataset obtained by any means, engineer an end-to-end data storage and processing pipeline. I am going to build an automatic data pipeline to ingest the information of YouTube videos by YouTube Data API and store in a database, build a model to predict the views, and deploy a web app for YouTuber creators to estimate the views of their videos and optimize the titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnail, etc.
